        <h2>Tradition vs. Culture</h2><!--No 'bold,' this should be in the h2 CSS, give the h2 a font-weight.-->
        <p>
            <b>Culture</b> is deep-rooted and learned social behavior, ideas, and customs that a certain group or society has combined throughout their lives and deemed socially acceptable. 
            It is an umbrella term that identifies shared knowledge, beliefs, ethics, and laws, which influence and establish morals, values, and a sense of community.
            For example, leaving a gratuitous monetary tip for taxi drivers, restaurant servers, hotel staff, and salon workers is an American cultural practice. 
            Americans often leave an amount that shows their appreciation for the worker or is appropriate to the service and quality provided. 
            Conversely, waiters from other countries consider tipping rude, earn a livable wage from their job, and do not rely on tips in the same way as some American servers. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <b>Tradition</b> is a specific term used to describe individual or group practices and beliefs. 
           It is often unique and passed down through generations for all ages to partake and enjoy. 
           There are no rules to tradition, but there are guidelines that establish tolerable approaches to the tradition and its values. 
           For example, in Japan, Hinamatsuri (Girls Day) is celebrated by families in Japan to honor their daughters and wish them happiness and success. 
           Although this is a cultural practice within the country, each family has their own way of celebrating, making it a tradition as well.
